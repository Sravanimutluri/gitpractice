    * Countinous Deployment
* Thats why it is also called as CI/CD pipelines.
## CI/CD Pipelines
#### Countinous Intigration:
* Continuous integration (CI) is the process of automatically building and testing code every time a team member commits code changes to version control. A code commit to the main or trunk branch of a shared repository triggers the automated build system to build, test, and validate the full branch.
#### Countinous Delivery:
* Continuous delivery (CD) is the process of automating build, test, configuration, and deployment from a build to a production environment. A release pipeline can create multiple testing or staging environments to automate infrastructure creation and deploy new builds.
#### Countinous Deployment:
* Continuous deployment (the other possible "CD") can refer to automatically releasing a developerâ€™s changes from the repository to production, where it is usable by customers. It addresses the problem of overloading operations teams with manual processes that slow down app delivery.
